# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the mobile responsiveness and multi-device screen adaptation of the vocabulary training application. Currently, the main application interface (index.html) has limited mobile support, while other pages have better responsive design. The goal is to ensure a consistent, user-friendly experience across all device types including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the vocabulary training interface to be fully responsive and easy to use on my smartphone, so that I can practice vocabulary effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a mobile device THEN the interface SHALL adapt to the screen size with appropriate scaling
2. WHEN the screen width is below 768px THEN the layout SHALL switch to a mobile-optimized single-column design
3. WHEN a user interacts with form elements on mobile THEN the input fields SHALL be appropriately sized for touch interaction
4. WHEN the quiz area is displayed on mobile THEN all controls SHALL remain accessible and properly sized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tablet user, I want the application to utilize the available screen space efficiently, so that I can have an optimal learning experience on medium-sized screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a tablet (768px-1024px) THEN the layout SHALL optimize for the available screen space
2. WHEN form controls are displayed on tablet THEN they SHALL be arranged in a logical grid that utilizes screen width effectively
3. WHEN the quiz interface is active on tablet THEN the Lumi character SHALL position appropriately without interfering with content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user switching between devices, I want consistent functionality and visual hierarchy across all screen sizes, so that I can seamlessly continue my learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches from desktop to mobile THEN all core functionality SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN the application loads on any device THEN the viewport meta tag SHALL ensure proper scaling
3. WHEN interactive elements are displayed THEN they SHALL meet minimum touch target sizes (44px minimum)
4. WHEN text content is displayed THEN font sizes SHALL scale appropriately for readability on all devices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the authentication forms and navigation to be touch-friendly, so that I can easily log in and navigate the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication forms are displayed on mobile THEN input fields SHALL be full-width and appropriately spaced
2. WHEN buttons are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be large enough for comfortable touch interaction
3. WHEN the header navigation is displayed on mobile THEN it SHALL adapt to smaller screens without content overflow
4. WHEN dropdown selectors are used on mobile THEN they SHALL be easily accessible and readable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with a small screen device, I want the quiz interface and Lumi character to adapt intelligently, so that they don't interfere with my learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the quiz area is active on small screens THEN the Lumi character SHALL reposition to avoid blocking content
2. WHEN control buttons are displayed in the quiz area THEN they SHALL remain accessible on all screen sizes
3. WHEN the quiz progress and statistics are shown THEN they SHALL be clearly visible and readable on mobile
4. WHEN audio controls are displayed THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized for touch interaction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want consistent responsive design patterns across all pages, so that the codebase is maintainable and user experience is uniform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responsive breakpoints are defined THEN they SHALL be consistent across all application pages
2. WHEN CSS media queries are implemented THEN they SHALL follow a mobile-first approach
3. WHEN responsive utilities are created THEN they SHALL be reusable across different components
4. WHEN testing responsive design THEN it SHALL work correctly on common device sizes and orientations
